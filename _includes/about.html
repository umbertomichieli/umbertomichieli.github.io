            		<p>I am a Computer Vision and Deep Learning enthusiast and my goal is to encourage the deployment of AI into everyday life.</p>
                    <p>I was born in Italy in 1994. I got my B.Sc and M.Sc. respectively in Information Engineering (2016) and in Telecommunication Engineering (2018) from the University of Padova. <br/>
                    Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Information Engineering of the same University under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=xk2N2wkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"> Pietro Zanuttigh</a>. </p>
                    <p>My main research interests are:<br/>
                    - <b>Continual Learning for semantic segmentation:</b> deep learning models should incrementally learn to segment and to label new classes over time.<br/>
                    - <b>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation:</b> we would like to train deep neural networks on large synthetic datasets, where the generation of the ground-truth is inexpensive, and then adapt them to real dataset without labels. <br/>
                    </p>

                    <p>Check out the publications section to know more about these topics and the <a href="http://lttm.dei.unipd.it">Multimedia Technology and Telecommunication Lab</a> at University of Padova.
